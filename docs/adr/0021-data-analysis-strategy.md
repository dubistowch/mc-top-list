# ADR 0021: Data Analysis Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
After implementing the new data structure in [ADR 0019](./0019-new-data-structure.md), we have rich aggregated data that can provide valuable insights about Minecraft resources across different platforms. We need a structured approach to extract meaningful information from this data.

## Decision
We will implement the following data analysis strategies:

### 1. Resource Popularity Analysis
- **Cross-Platform Trends**
  - Compare download counts across platforms for similar resource types
  - Identify most popular resources in each category
  - Track popularity changes over time

- **Platform-Specific Metrics**
  - Platform market share by resource type
  - Platform-specific growth rates
  - User preference patterns

### 2. Resource Type Analysis
- **Category Distribution**
  - Resource type distribution across platforms
  - Most active resource categories
  - Growth trends by resource type

- **Version Compatibility**
  - Most supported Minecraft versions
  - Version adoption rates
  - Backward compatibility patterns

### 3. Author Analysis
- **Author Activity Metrics**
  - Most prolific authors
  - Cross-platform author presence
  - Author specialization (by resource type)

### 4. Update Pattern Analysis
- **Resource Maintenance**
  - Update frequency by resource type
  - Average time between updates
  - Resource longevity analysis

- **Version Migration**
  - Speed of adaptation to new Minecraft versions
  - Version support patterns

### 5. Time-Based Analysis
- **Temporal Patterns**
  - Release timing patterns
  - Update frequency trends
  - Seasonal variations in activity

### 6. Implementation Details
```python
class ResourceAnalyzer:
    def analyze_popularity(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "platform_distribution": self._calculate_platform_distribution(data),
            "top_resources": self._get_top_resources(data),
            "growth_trends": self._calculate_growth_trends(data)
        }
    
    def analyze_versions(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "version_distribution": self._calculate_version_distribution(data),
            "update_patterns": self._analyze_update_patterns(data)
        }
    
    def analyze_authors(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "author_rankings": self._calculate_author_rankings(data),
            "cross_platform_presence": self._analyze_cross_platform_authors(data)
        }
```

### 7. Visualization Recommendations
- Time series charts for download trends
- Heatmaps for version compatibility
- Bar charts for platform comparisons
- Network graphs for author relationships
- Treemaps for resource type distribution

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Better understanding of resource ecosystem
2. Data-driven decision making for platform development
3. Valuable insights for resource authors
4. Improved user experience through informed recommendations
5. Better resource categorization and discovery
6. Early trend detection capabilities

### Negative
1. Additional computational overhead
2. Increased storage requirements for analysis results
3. Need for regular analysis updates
4. Potential privacy considerations for author analysis
5. Complex data normalization requirements

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Implement incremental analysis for efficiency
2. Cache analysis results with appropriate TTL
3. Use asynchronous processing for heavy computations
4. Implement data anonymization where appropriate
5. Provide API endpoints for analysis results
6. Regular validation of analysis accuracy
