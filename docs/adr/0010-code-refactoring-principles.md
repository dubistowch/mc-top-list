# ADR 0010: Code Refactoring Principles

## Status
Accepted

## Context
To ensure code maintainability and extensibility, we need to establish clear code refactoring principles. These principles will guide us in optimizing the existing codebase to make it more concise, efficient, and maintainable.

## Decision
We will adopt the following refactoring principles:

### 1. Core Principles
- Remove all non-essential code and functionality
- Ensure each class and function has a single responsibility
- Avoid over-engineering
- Use type hints consistently

### 2. SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### 3. Code Style
- Strict adherence to PEP 8
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Comprehensive type hints
- Essential and accurate docstrings
- Black for code formatting
- Ruff for linting

### 4. Project Structure
```
scraper/
├── api_clients/     # Platform-specific API clients
├── interfaces/      # Abstract base classes and interfaces
├── models/         # Data models and schemas
├── utils/          # Shared utilities
└── config/         # Configuration files
```

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all new code
- Integration tests for API clients
- Type checking with mypy
- Minimum 80% test coverage

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Reduced technical debt
- Easier unit testing
- Better error handling
- Consistent code style

### Negative
- Time investment for refactoring
- Need to update existing tests
- Learning curve for new tools
- Stricter code review process
