# ADR 0001: Use Python for Scraper

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a scripting language to build and maintain our Minecraft mod/plugin scraper. The solution needs to address:
- Data scraping requirements from multiple sources
- Ease of maintenance and contribution
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Performance considerations for regular scraping tasks

## Decision
We will use Python 3.x as the primary language for the scraper implementation:
- Python version: 3.9 or higher
- Key libraries:
  - `requests` for HTTP requests
  - `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing
  - `json` for data handling
- Code organization:
  - Main scraper code in `/scraper` directory
  - Site-specific scrapers in `/scraper/sites`
  - Shared utilities in `/scraper/utils`

## Consequences
### Positive
- Rich ecosystem of libraries for web scraping
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Easy to read and maintain code
- Strong integration with GitHub Actions

### Negative
- Need to manage Python dependencies
- Must ensure consistent Python environment across different platforms
- May need to handle rate limiting and other scraping challenges
