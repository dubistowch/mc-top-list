# ADR 0020: Content Creator Weekly Insights

## Status
Proposed

## Context
As a content creator/streamer, we need to provide valuable insights about Minecraft resources that would interest viewers and help them stay updated with the community trends. The aggregated data from different platforms can be transformed into engaging weekly content that highlights interesting developments in the Minecraft modding community.

## Decision
We will implement a weekly insights generator focusing on the following aspects:

### 1. Weekly Trending Content
- **Rising Stars**
  - New mods/plugins that gained significant popularity
  - Breakthrough content creators
  - Unexpected viral resources

- **Community Favorites**
  - Most downloaded new releases
  - Most active discussion topics
  - Community choice highlights

### 2. Version Spotlights
- **Version Compatibility Updates**
  - New mods/plugins supporting latest Minecraft versions
  - Popular resources updated for new versions
  - Compatibility change alerts

- **Version Migration Trends**
  - Most popular Minecraft versions for modding
  - Version adoption trends
  - Legacy version support status

### 3. Content Categories Focus
- **Weekly Category Highlights**
  - Trending categories (e.g., Adventure mods, Building plugins)
  - Emerging content types
  - Underrated gems in each category

- **Creator Recommendations**
  - Featured content creator of the week
  - Notable resource collections
  - Theme-based recommendations (e.g., RPG week, Building week)

### 4. Community Engagement Metrics
- **Platform Activity**
  - Most active platforms
  - Community engagement levels
  - Platform-specific trending topics

- **Discussion Topics**
  - Hot topics in mod/plugin development
  - Community feedback trends
  - Common feature requests

### 5. Implementation Example
```python
class WeeklyInsightsGenerator:
    def generate_weekly_report(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "trending": {
                "rising_stars": self._find_rising_stars(data),
                "community_favorites": self._get_community_favorites(data),
                "weekly_highlights": self._generate_highlights(data)
            },
            "version_updates": {
                "new_support": self._get_version_updates(data),
                "popular_versions": self._analyze_version_trends(data)
            },
            "category_focus": {
                "trending_categories": self._get_trending_categories(data),
                "featured_creator": self._select_featured_creator(data)

        }
